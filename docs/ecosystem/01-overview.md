Primitive is an open-source protocol with an open-source interface hosted at [https://app.primitive.finance](https://app.primitive.finance).

Make sure to bookmark it to prevent using a fake app.

In addition to being hosted on a centralized domain, the interface is accessible through IPFS or running the app locally.
