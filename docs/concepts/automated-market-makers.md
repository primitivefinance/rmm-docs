# Automated Market Makers

### What is an AMM?

An Automated Market Maker, "AMM", is a trading rule that governs how two or more assets are exchanged for each other. In the context of DeFi, this rule is "automated" because it's enforced as immutable smart contract code on the Ethereum blockchain.

### How do AMMs work?

An AMM trading rule is an equation that defines a relationship between the reserves of two or more assets in the smart contract. Swaps from one asset to the other are allowed if the trading rule still holds after the desired swap is accounted for in the reserves.&#x20;
