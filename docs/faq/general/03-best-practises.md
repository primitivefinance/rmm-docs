# Best Practises

Smart contracts and decentralized applications are brand new technologies that might require some time to be assimilated. Sadly, swindlers are using this as an opportunity to organize scams targeting the less aware users.
Here is a collection of *best practises*, aiming at protecting our community.

## General

### Domain Verification

One of the most important check when using a decentralized application is to be sure that you are on the right domain: [app.primitive.finance](https://app.primitive.finance). Common practices are to either bookmark the valid address or type it directly in your browser, avoid using links from search engines (especially sponsored ones)!

### Wallet Safety

You should **never** disclose your private key (or seed phrase) with anyone! Sharing this information with a malicious entity could result in the loss of all of your assets, including the control of your wallet.
