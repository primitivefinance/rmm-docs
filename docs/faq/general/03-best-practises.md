# Best Practices

Here is a collection of *best practices* to follow when interacting with Primitive, or any crypto protocol:

## General

### Domain Verification

One of the most important check when using a decentralized application is to be sure that you are using a verified domain, for Primitive this is [app.primitive.xyz](https://app.primitive.xyz). Common practices are to either bookmark the domain or type it directly in your browser, avoid using links from search engines (especially sponsored ones)!

### Wallet Safety

You should **never** disclose your private key (or seed phrase) with anyone! Sharing this information with a malicious entity could result in the loss of all of your assets, including the control of your wallet.

### Token Approvals

Interacting with the Protocol requires token approvals, granting the immutable (and audited) smart contract control over the approved tokens. It is a best practice to revoke approvals when you are done using the protocol.
