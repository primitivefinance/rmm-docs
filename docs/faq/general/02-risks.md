# Risks

The security of our protocol is our main priority, however it's impossible to guarantee a risk-free environment, and it makes sense to be aware of all its components.

## Smart Contract Risks

### Were the RMM contracts audited?

Yes, our contracts were audited by multiple leading security companies, you can learn more on our [dedicated page](/technical/security/audits).

### Are there any admin Keys?

No, our contracts are completely decentralized and permissionless, we *DO NOT* control them by any means.

### Are the contracts upgradeable?

Once again no.

## Usage Risks

### Are there any financial risks using RMM?

Yes, we recommend reading carefully our documentation or asking questions on our Discord server if some aspects of our protocol remain unclear.
